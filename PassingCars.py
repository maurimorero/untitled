#A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.
#Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:
#0 represents a car traveling east,
#1 represents a car traveling west.
#The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 â‰¤ P < Q < N, is passing when P is traveling to the east
# and Q is traveling to the west.
